    <h4>STILL CURIOUS?</h4>
    <p>Traditionally, multi-data center strategies were deployed primarily to address disaster recovery scenarios. However, organizations today are headed for a future where multi-data-center deployments are no longer just for disaster recovery, but used to meet increasing workloads, scale, and user experience demands.</p>
    <p>Check out our eBook, <em>"From Disaster Recovery to Active-Active: NuoDB and Multi-Data Center Deployments"</em>. In this eBook, we discuss the options organizations have today with multi-data-center deployments, the spectrum of multi-data-center configurations, the benefits and limitations to each, and what NuoDB currently offers in multi-data center deployments.</p>
